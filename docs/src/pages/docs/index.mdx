# tsai-registry

Welcome to **tsai-registry**, an open-source library of pre-built agents, tools, and workflows for Mastra framework.

## üéØ What is tsai-registry?

tsai-registry is a comprehensive collection of ready-to-use Mastra components designed to accelerate AI application development. It serves as a centralized repository where developers can discover, use, and contribute high-quality agents and tools.

## üöÄ Why was it created?

The AI development ecosystem often suffers from fragmentation and repetitive work. Developers frequently rebuild the same agents and tools across different projects. tsai-registry was created to:

- **Eliminate duplication** - Provide battle-tested components instead of starting from scratch
- **Accelerate development** - Get productive immediately with pre-configured agents
- **Foster collaboration** - Enable the community to share and improve components together
- **Ensure quality** - Maintain consistent standards across all components

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Capabilities

### Agent Library
Access a growing collection of specialized agents:
- **Weather Agent** - Real-time weather data and forecasts
- **Exa Agent** - Advanced web search capabilities
- **Firecrawl Agent** - Intelligent web scraping
- **And many more...**

### Tool Collection
Reusable tools for common tasks:
- API integrations
- Data processing utilities
- Communication tools
- File manipulation helpers

### Workflow Templates
Complete workflows for complex scenarios:
- Multi-step data processing
- Agent orchestration patterns
- Integration workflows

## üîß How it works

### 1. Browse & Discover
Explore the registry to find components that match your needs:

```bash
# List all available components
npx tsai-registry list

# List specific component types
npx tsai-registry list agents
npx tsai-registry list tools
npx tsai-registry list workflows
```

### 2. Download Locally
Pull the source files directly into your project:

```bash
# Add a specific agent to your project
npx tsai-registry add weather-agent

# Add other components
